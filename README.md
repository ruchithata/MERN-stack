# MERN Stack Product Management App

A full-stack application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to **add, view, update, and delete products**.

This project helped me understand complete end-to-end development — from designing REST APIs to building a working frontend that consumes them.

---

## Features

### Product Operations
- Add new products (name, price, image URL)
- View all products in a product list
- Update existing product details
- Delete products

### Full-Stack Architecture
- REST API endpoints built with Node.js + Express
- MongoDB database with Mongoose models
- React frontend for UI and API interaction
- Axios for API calls
- Basic UI built using Chakra UI / Ark UI

---

## Tech Stack

### **Frontend**
- React  
- Chakra UI / Ark UI  
- Axios  

### **Backend**
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB + Mongoose

## How to Run the Project

### **1. Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruchithata/MERN-stack
cd MERN-stack
```

### **2. Install and start backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

### **2. Install and start frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### Create Product
`POST /api/products`

### Get All Products
`GET /api/products`

### Update Product
`PUT /api/products/:id`

### Delete Product
`DELETE /api/products/:id`

## What I Learned
This project helped me practice and understand:
- Connecting a MongoDB database to Express
- Implementing CRUD operations
- Structuring a full-stack MERN application
- Creating frontend components to interact with API routes
- Handling React state and API integration
- Understanding the flow of data: Database → Backend API → Frontend UI
