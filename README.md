# MERN Stack Product Management App  

A full-stack application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to **add, view, update, and delete products**.  
This project helped me understand complete end-to-end development — from designing REST APIs to building a clean, interactive UI.

---

## Features  

### Product Operations  
- Add new products (name, price, image URL)  
- View the full product list  
- Update existing product details  
- Delete products easily  

### Full-Stack Implementation  
- RESTful API endpoints for CRUD operations  
- MongoDB for database storage  
- Express server for routing and API logic  
- React for frontend UI  
- Chakra UI / Ark UI for clean and responsive styling  

---

## Tech Stack  

### **Frontend:**  
- React  
- Chakra UI / Ark UI  
- Axios  

### **Backend:**  
- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB + Mongoose

## How to Run the Project  

### **1️ Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruchithata/MERN-stack
cd MERN-stack

### **2 Install and start backend dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm start

### **3 Install and run frontend dependencies**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

## API Endpoints

### **Create Product**  
`POST /api/products`

### **Get All Products**  
`GET /api/products`

### **Update Product**  
`PUT /api/products/:id`

### **Delete Product**  
`DELETE /api/products/:id`

## What I Learned

This project helped me gain hands-on experience with:

- Designing and connecting a **MongoDB database** to Express APIs  
- Handling **CRUD operations** end-to-end  
- Using **React** to build dynamic, reusable UI components  
- Managing state efficiently across the app  
- Structuring full-stack codebases into **frontend and backend modules**  
- Working with **environment variables**, routing, and API integration  
- Understanding the flow: **Database → Backend API → Frontend UI**

---

## Future Improvements

I plan to enhance the project by adding:

- User **authentication** (JWT + protected routes)  
- Image upload support (**Cloudinary/Multer**)  
- Pagination + search filters  
- A cleaner, more responsive UI  
- Deployment on **Vercel + Render**  
- Unit + integration tests
